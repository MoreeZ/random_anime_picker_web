# Random anime picker

## Now working

Currently out of use. The REST API named Jikan API which this project has used has deprecated their getUserAnime endpoints. This means that the main funcitonality of this app has been completely disabled.

## Current situation.

Currently I got rid of the old source code as it was extremely outdated.
I created a new Gastby app and started implementing new design to the app.

## The plan
By the end of February I will launch a new version of this app which will communicate with my cloud server to authenticate users with the official MAL API.
For now the app is dead.
